# System Fetcher

## Overview

This application fetches systems from the Landscape Information Service
for a given customer identified by a given tenant.
Afterwards, the fetched systems are synchronized with the Compass database.
The goal is to provide the Compass a way to know all systems of 
a given customer (for a given tenant).
